## Welcome to my Homepage! 


I am an EC Engineer pursuing Undergraduate studies from Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata. Before that I have been to Hem Sheela Model School, from where I passed my Secondary(AISSE) and Senior Secondary(AISSCE). My hometown lies in the industrial belt of West Bengal i.e. Durgapur. I currently reside in Kolkata for my education purposes. I am highly fond of Indian classical music and have been exposed to this field ever since childhood. I also want to make significant contributions in this field. Also I take a keen interest in writing stories and muses. I have a YourQuote account(Go check out if you want!)where I used to post some of my writings.I had been the organizing committee member of On-Campus Hult Prize 2020-21(global entrepreneurship contest) and the Executive Content Writer at Codechef Campus Chapter. I have also worked with a renowned Digital Marketing startup _'Nincompoop'_ as the Content Head for their social pages. Alongwith this, I had been a part-time Educator at Unacademy for a few months.

My inspiration comes from my favorite quote :

**_"If you can breathe you can stand, if you can stand you can fight."_**
